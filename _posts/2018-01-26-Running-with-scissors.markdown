Being an adult (or a reasonable facsimile of one) and having hobbies is pretty fun because you can kindasorta do what you want. There's not really someone telling you that you can't have the thing that you want, your imagination is the limit, and your wallet...

"Hey cool, you're going to build your own keyboard? I bet you'll save a lot of money."

* cue laugh track *

So, the first part is easy but it's not for the weak-hearted, as it involves throwing money at ridiculous things.

Here's most of the sites I used:

- aliexpress.com [Cherry Switches, I used a mix of Reds and Browns]
- hidden-lab.com [Thermochromatic keycaps]
- keeb.io [Iris PCB's, Case Plates, Pro Micros]
- wasdkeyboards.com [Custom Printed Keycaps]
- pexonpcs.co.uk [Custom cables TRRS and USB]
- hotpopfactory.com [Local company that I asked to cut acryllic for the case.]

Without a doubt the next part is the hardest... waiting for all of the things you ordered to arrive.

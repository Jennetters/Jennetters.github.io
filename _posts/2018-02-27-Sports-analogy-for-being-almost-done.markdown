I've been using a 60% keyboard for some time after I realized my wrists were more comfortable when I didn't have to leap over the (rarely used) number pad to reach the mouse throughout the day.

- decided I needed a split keyboard
- couldn't find one that suited my wants
- We have a slack channel (search for "Jennette, where have you been? You belong in this channe")
- decided to make my own.

Here we go wheeeeeeeeeeee.

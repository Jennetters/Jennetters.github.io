Whelp. Clearly Windows was the culprit. I had a coworker help me flash the Pro Micros and he was able to do it with no troubles on the first try. Neat. Thanks for nothing WANDOWS.

Now, I'd be a big fat liar if I told you I thought everything would work on my first attempt. I've got a few problems. The left keyboard has a dead row... *A*, *S*, *D*, *F*, and the right keyboard has two dead keys, *U* and *J*.

Crummy.

Now I'm suspecting that I _did_ damage the Pro Micro on Monday. I'll have to dig in a bit later. 

**Plus side** - I've got a few colleagues with extra Pro Micros which will reduce my waiting time if I need to replace it.
**Down side** - More desoldering is definitely in my future.

C'est la vie.

Still, see how pretty?

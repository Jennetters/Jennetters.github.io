I always make sure to test connections every step of the way, it's so much easier than fixing problems after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, lo and behold! After flashing the pro micro successfully, and then connecting the microprocessors to the keyboard, I was a bit surprised that it wasn't working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't my first rodeo, so I didn't expect anything to be perfect the first go around but it took some tinkering and digging to figure out that the pro-micro pins were slightly different from the pins used in the dactyl files on qmk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a big problem, you just need to make sure the pins listed in the config.h file correspond to your wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some &lt;a href="https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2020-09-04-show-your-work/#id1"&gt;&lt;span class="problematic" id="id2"&gt;`progress pics`__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some resources that helped me out:&lt;/p&gt;

I was asked to have a go at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ramonimbao/dactyl-ez2print"&gt;Dactyl EZ-to-Print&lt;/a&gt;... turns out it wasn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; easy to actually print. I had some difficulties with sagging and getting thex openings for the switches to stay crisp but in the end, I made it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="https://jennetters.github.io/images/dactylEZ/Dactyl_is_Art.thumb.jpg" alt="Art!"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the parts ready to go I started following the assembly on the repo for the case, but it looks you're meant to put the back on before wiring, just to hold it together... soooooo I went rogue and did my own thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Attempt 1 of ??</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-07-3d-printing-trials/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a keyboard off of a purchased PCB has been fun, but like any good mechanical keyboard junkie, you very quickly discover that it's a slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole reason I started on this journey was to be able to get my hands on the most ergonomic keyboard, for my poor hands, that I could possibly find. And it wasn't long before I started lusting after a Dactyl of my very own. With no readily available PCB's it's a bit more of a challenge to build, but I think after building 2 keyboards successfully, I can figure it out with a little help from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step one - Picking the right Dactyl for my needs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the easy part. I really like the Dactyl Manuform and think the 5x6 is ideal: https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been flip-flopping between the Iris (50%) and Fourier (40%) and like them both quite a bit, for different reasons, but I think that the Iris is a bit more user-friendly for everyday use. That's the main reason why, I'm opting for more keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step two - Building the case. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D Printing is finicky business. I purchased a second-hand printer to learn the ropes and with hopes of getting a Dactyl out of it. It was clear from the start that the resolution was more suited to drafts but I still had high hopes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of tinkering and practicing on smaller items to iron out the details, I was ready to give the Dactyl a go... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="GMI8ns0"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/GMI8ns0"&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it was clearly a failure. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-07-3d-printing-trials/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:01:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

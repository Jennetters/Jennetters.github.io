The thing about polymer clay is that it's super cheap and comes in a ton of colours, it's also blendable so you can fully customize the shade. But it just wasn't meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the clay was soft enough to mold, it was pretty easy to build on to the bottom layer of the keyboard plate, but then I was left with a dilemma of how to bake the clay. I tried removing the clay from the plate but this left it distorted and with fingerprints. I was also trying to line up the top and bottom plates to ensure the middle layer was a perfect fit, and it kept getting into the pcb/switches which was making it hard to remove. So after a few attempts at making guards/molds/templates with no success I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think it's not a bad idea for anyone wishing to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the aftermath. I had to use a cotton bud and some alcohol to clean up the residue from the switches and plates, which was fine, when I noticed some fine scratches on the base plate of the keyboard. I had used a knife to gently trim/shape the clay in one of my attempts and accidentially scratched the plate. No big deal, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wrong!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time had passed after this when I noticed some behavioural issues with the keyboard. As it turns out, the fine scratches were just enough to expose the conductive layer of the base plate, which was making just enough contact with the pro micro to cause a short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the microcontroller survived with no damage and I was able to fix the issue with some electrical tape. Problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even better, while I was using some post-it notes to test the space between the microcontroller and the board, I realized, they were the same colour as the keycaps. What luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though I don't have a super ballin' hand-built middle layer to match the exact shaed of my orange keycaps, I was able to wrap the brass standoffs in orange to up the aesthetic a notch or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valuable lesson from my last build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Solder pro micro header pins to the board first, not the pro micro.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Put down some electrical tape before attaching the pro micro.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Trim the pins from the switches after soldering, they may not look long but they can still cause problems. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flush cutters are your friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fourier</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><category>Staggered</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-05-28-breakfast-of-champions/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 13:00:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wait is over!</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-05-27-the-wait-is-over/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; possible to build a mechanical keyboard, and a sweet one at that, on the cheap.

Or do not. There is no try.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year on May fourth I was travelling back from Birmingham, UK, and wore my Rogue One tshirt in honour of Star Wars day. It was fun that many of the airport officials/security guards noticed it. Yes, I did actually say "May the fourth be with you" to a customs officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the Iris keyboard was fun, but anyone who's built a mechanical keyboard knows that it can quickly become a bit of an addiction/hobby... I need moooore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen a few variations of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard"&gt;Dacyl keyboard&lt;/a&gt; and I want one. Real bad. Part of my obsession stems from the hunt for an ergonomic split keyboard and this is some next level stuff. It's dreamy. I've also stumbled across a few different build guides where people hand wired them. So I think that's my next challenge. Who doesn't want to dabble in some pcb-free electronics every now and then? This brings me back to Yoda's quote and my approach to all the things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pfft. I can do that too.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm still super in love with the Iris keyboard, I'm not giving her up and won't go as crazy ordering custom &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; for the Dactyl, but I'll make it look good. I'm going to keep it a bit more cost effective, as much as you can when building a mechanical keyboard, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to play the waiting game... again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun, I also ordered parts to build Keeb.io's Fourier 40% staggered split, because. Just because. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For added funtimes, I also, also ordered a Chocopad PCB, from &lt;a href="https://keeb.io"&gt;Keeb.io&lt;/a&gt;, and some Kailh switches/caps, from &lt;a href="https://novelkeys.xyz"&gt;NovelKeys&lt;/a&gt;, to make a macropad for gaming. We'll see how that goes another other time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to waiting...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a May 4th throwback to my last day in Birmingham, right before heading to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note my sweet selfie skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>dactyl keyboard</category><category>fourier</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-05-04-may-the-fourth-live-long/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2018 09:49:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Living that ortho life</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-04-17-living-that-ortho-life/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whelp. It's been about a month and a half since I finished my build of the Iris which is my main keyboard at work. Today I think it's safe to say I've officially adopted (adapted to?) the ortho life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://jennetters.github.io/images/wpm_04-17-18.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, ok, I'm not the fastest typer, but I think I'm above average and it's nice to be back up to my speed! Switching to an ortholinear keyboard was a bit more challenging than I expected. Even though it's still qwerty, the alignment makes a massive difference and changing 20+ years of muscle memory was a real challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just have to practice using staggered and ortholinear keyboards more frequently so I don't stuble as much when I switch back and forth. #keebstruggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>iris keyboard</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>pictures</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-04-17-living-that-ortho-life/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:35:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The wait is over!</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-04-05-the-wait-is-over/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew from the very beginning that I would settle for nothing less than the best cables and, of course, I wanted them the way I wanted them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/XqQY4"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/a/XqQY4"&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cables are exactly what I had in my head, they're perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot pink of the cables matches the acrylic used for the case, but I didn't forsee that the black plates on the keyoard would affect the colour of the case as much as they do, giving it a more orange look. I do have a few ideas for offsetting the orange colour, for one I still haven't added LEDs to the keyboard, that'll help, and/or I could possibly line the inside facing surfaces of the plates with white paint/film/etc to help reflect the pink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'm thrilled that everything is the way I wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these pieces in place and the Iris being complete, I need another project to start... Hmm... decisions, decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>iris keyboard</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>pictures</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-04-05-the-wait-is-over/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2018 16:15:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>From 77 to 30 words per minute... hold on to your butts.</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-03-02-from-77-to-30-wpm/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have done the thing! Today (right now, in fact) my new pretty keyboard is fully fuctional!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a co-worker flash the keyboard on his mac, thanks for nothing Wandows, which worked without issue. So now here I am with my new sweet setup and having a grand old time fighting muscle meory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago I borrowed a co-workers "let's split" and I managed to average 44 which is not terrible. Right now my biggest problem is that I used the upper thumbkeys for space which feels less natural. I can move them later if it becomes a problem. That's the beauty of a custom keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>iris keyboard</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>pictures</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-03-02-from-77-to-30-wpm/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:55:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Adventures in desoldering</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-03-01-adventures-in-desoldering/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally had a chance to open up the keyboard and see what the problem was with the dead keys. As it turns out, the issue with the U and J keys was that I didn't solder the switches. And here I thought I was being so careful, must have been over excited. So I solderd those and plugged the board in and TADAA!!! Right half is fully functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the left half, which had the dead row. Well, this is my life now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/vdXBm"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/a/vdXBm"&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked all of the diodes and paths, but I could see one pin on the controller didn't appear to be soldered, so I tried to solder it and it just. wouldn't. flow. I'm confident that I damged the Pro Micro when I desoldered it on Monday and the connection for that pin is just toast. I tried several times and couldn't get it soldered to make the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am faced with a really, really gross dillemma. Because of the construction of the board/case plates, if I want to get at the top side of the board to remove the header pins and attach a new Pro Micro, I've literally got to desolder all of the switches on the board in order to be able to remove the plate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super disgusting, right?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, I could desolder the Pro Micro and leave the pins on the board, then just put a new one in its place. This was harder than it seemed, even though it looked like I had a clean pin I still couldn't get the Pro Micro off. So, I did what any sane person would do, I grabed some pliers and wire cutters and obliterated the pro micro, leaving the pins intact. Then I desoldered the pins and cleaned everything with a little bit of rubbing alcohol. Good as new... if new was chewed up by a dog and spit out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attaching the new Pro Micro onto the existing header pins which were a little less than straight was a bit of a challenge, I used some needle nosed pliers to feed them through one at a time but I managed to get it and solder it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm back to having issues flashing the board because, Wandows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, it's way past my bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>iris keyboard</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>pictures</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-03-01-adventures-in-desoldering/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 04:18:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Who needs A/D/S/F/G/U/J Anyway?</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-02-28-who-needs-asdfg-anway/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whelp. Clearly Windows was the culprit. I had a coworker help me flash the Pro Micros and he was able to do it with no troubles on the first try. Neat. Thanks for nothing WANDOWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'd be a big fat liar if I told you I thought everything would work on my first attempt. I've got a few problems. The left keyboard has a dead row... &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;, and the right keyboard has two dead keys, &lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crummy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm suspecting that I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; damage the Pro Micro on Monday. I'll have to dig in a bit later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus side&lt;/strong&gt; - I've got a few colleagues with extra Pro Micros which will reduce my waiting time if I need to replace it.
&lt;strong&gt;Down side&lt;/strong&gt; - More desoldering is definitely in my future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C'est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, see how pretty?&lt;/p&gt;

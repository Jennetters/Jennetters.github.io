These Dactyl boards sure are popular!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler Alert: That's because they're great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I post a lot projects that I'm tinkering with on my &lt;a href="http://www.instagram.com/jennettereid"&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; account and my boss reached out to me to ask about comissioning a custom Dactyl Manuform as a surprise for his wife! WHEE! Of course I was totally up for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really, really, love building mechanical keyboards but I already have 4. Considering I only have one desk and one set of hands, there's no way I need more (Said no member of r/mechanicalkeyboards, ever.). If I can build keyboards for other people, then I get the joy of building them &lt;strike&gt;and none of the hassle of choosing a favourite among my keyboard babies. Err, forget I said that.&lt;/strike&gt; That's not to say I'm open to doing comissions for just &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt;, they do take up a considerable amount of my time.  I already have too many hobbies to squeeze into what little free time I do have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going over some options, we decided to keep the board relatively quiet and went with linear switches (Cherry MX Red) for the alpha keys, and Tactile switches (Cherry Brown) for the modifiers. This gives some more feedback when typing and learning to type on the dactyl. We also decided, since he liked the gradient of my Iris keycaps, to get the keycaps printed from &lt;a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/"&gt;WASD Keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. I've used them before and their customer service is outstanding, the prices are very reasonable and they're lightening quick with production. The bonus with designing your own keycaps is that you can change the labels to suit your layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this was printed on the Prusa is MK3 with black PLA filament which really needs no finishing. I find that's the biggest bonus of upgrading my printer. All that's left to do after printing is ripping out the supports, which is kind of the best part!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after waiting for the rest of the supplies to arrive (RJ9 Cables and Connectors, and some more Microcontrollers) it was finally time to assemble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the finished board, I think it's really sharp! (I know, I know I'm biased. What's your point?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm getting quicker at handwiring these bad boys, though it's generally not a quick biuld. Even with practice the shape makes the corners awkward so, it still takes a good 5-8 hours of tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to need to take a break for a while, although I still have some pro micros, switches, cables and connectors on hand.... you know, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>photos</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-05-03-its_litt/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2019 03:27:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>When your bestie requests a dactyl that's 'Purple and Loud AF' this is the end result...</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-04-25-purple_hills/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been a collaborative work-in-progress for the better part of two months. Collaborative in that Dana was the designer and I was the builder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my bestie, Dana, wanted a Dactyl that was purple and loud. Easy. We both scoured Aliexpress and put together a list of keycaps that would work for ortholinear keyboards (it's hard to find sets that are 1-u so you need to be creative with the available caps in a stock set.) and I got all the other components ordered and this is the final result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/LEhOjHg"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/LEhOjHg"&gt;Purple Gradient Dactyl Manuform 5x6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the best pictures, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't wait to share with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bhhf3m/my_bestie_requested_a_purple_keyboard_that_was/"&gt;r/mechanicalkeyboards&lt;/a&gt; and... well now I have a whole lot of people wanting to be my best friend. Hah, joke's on them. There's no room at the inn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>photos</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-04-25-purple_hills/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 02:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>BOOM! One Week of using the dactyl manuform</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-03-13-boom/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a solid week of using the Dactyl Manuform exclusively at work my typing is just about back to where it was before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/CVGmEM3"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/CVGmEM3.jpg" title="source: imgur.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention that I also use a mouse layer on this board and haven't used a physical mouse since September, so my hands are literally on the keyboard the entire time I'm at my desk. It's been pretty convenient and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already received two requests to build more of these for friends/coworkers so I'll add pics/info when I get into that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/kJAH5mF"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/kJAH5mF.png" title="source: imgur.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too shabby. Typing on the manuform has been much easier than I expected, the height is a source of mild discomfort so I will get myself a taller wrist support or print the matching ones to go with the dactyl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordo.j/" target="_new"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; takes fantastic pictures so I asked him to help me grab some cool shots in the alley beside our office. Here's what he came up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/TnoaMML"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/TnoaMML"&gt;Completed Dactyl Manuform (5x6)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty great, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty darn pleased with this board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>photos</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-03-08-pictures-of-dactyl_manuform/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 20:45:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

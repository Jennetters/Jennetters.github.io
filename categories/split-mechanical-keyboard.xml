&lt;p&gt;Mapping the wires to the controller was pretty quick work and ended up being less soldering than using a pcb where you need to use the header pins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last steps are to find a suitable cable, then programming and I'll be done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2021-12-05-hand-wiring-adventures-part3/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 02:04:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hand Wiring Adventures: Part 2</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2020-12-04-hand-wiring-adventures-part2/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a bomb, but it's gonna be &lt;i&gt;da bomb&lt;/i&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;I made solid progress starting the columns, using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard"&gt;assembly log from tshort on github&lt;/a&gt; as a guide. Because I'm just soldering to the pins on the switches there's a lot less movement of parts, making it much quicker. I laid out the wire along the column and used a marker to note where the pins lined up, then stripped the wire at these points and was able to solder each column in more or less one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps are to add the controller and trrs jacks. I know the dactyl assembly log uses rj9 cable, but I've got trrs jacks handy and a few extra cables so I'm going to give them a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2020-12-04-hand-wiring-adventures-part2/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 03:10:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hand Wiring Adventures: Part 1</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-12-02-hand-wiring-adventures/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time has come to begin the Dactyl Manuform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to some incredibly fast shipping form Aliexpress, some forethought, and some borrowed supplies from co-workers I have everything I need to get cracking on this. Right off the bat, it's clear that completing the wiring in the case of the dactyl is tight at best, and downright impossible in the deepest corners where I found myself melting the case with the soldering tip more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had really grand visions of knocking everyone's socks off with how tidy my wiring was going to turn out, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/u9Jv7SH"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/u9Jv7SH"&gt;Dactyl Build 12-01-2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the quaity of this print is way better that anything I could produce, I found that some of the switches would pop out when removing the keycaps and considering there is no circuit board to hold them in place, you wouldn't want to rip out wires just for swapping a cap. For that reason, I used a bit of hot glue on the underside of the switches to help secure them to the case. I also added bits of hot glue to hold the wires where I wanted them for the rows, and I'll likely do the same for the columns. However, it's clear that this is ruining the aesthetic I was going for. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also being doubly cautious and checking each solder connection as I go so that I, hopefully, will have a fully functioning keyboard when I'm done. I'm a little worried about shorts, but I think the hot glue will also act as insulation when needed and will secure the wires so there's no accidential connections.... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-12-02-hand-wiring-adventures/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 01:24:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>3D Printing Success?</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-11-19-3d-printing-success/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many, many attempts at printing the cases for the Dactyl and many upgrades and repairs to our printer I figured it just wasn't meant to be.

&lt;p&gt;As much as I wanted to do it by myself, sometimes you need to ask for help along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just need a few more supplies and then I'll be ready to start building! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-11-19-3d-printing-success/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 03:28:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fourier Upgrade!</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-08-fourier-upgrade/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time for Halloween... latest upgrade to the Fourier!&lt;/p&gt;

Attempt 1 of ??</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-07-3d-printing-trials/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a keyboard off of a purchased PCB has been fun, but like any good mechanical keyboard junkie, you very quickly discover that it's a slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole reason I started on this journey was to be able to get my hands on the most ergonomic keyboard, for my poor hands, that I could possibly find. And it wasn't long before I started lusting after a Dactyl of my very own. With no readily available PCB's it's a bit more of a challenge to build, but I think after building 2 keyboards successfully, I can figure it out with a little help from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step one - Picking the right Dactyl for my needs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the easy part. I really like the Dactyl Manuform and think the 5x6 is ideal: https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been flip-flopping between the Iris (50%) and Fourier (40%) and like them both quite a bit, for different reasons, but I think that the Iris is a bit more user-friendly for everyday use. That's the main reason why, I'm opting for more keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step two - Building the case. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D Printing is finicky business. I purchased a second-hand printer to learn the ropes and with hopes of getting a Dactyl out of it. It was clear from the start that the resolution was more suited to drafts but I still had high hopes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of tinkering and practicing on smaller items to iron out the details, I was ready to give the Dactyl a go... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="GMI8ns0"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/GMI8ns0"&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it was clearly a failure. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-07-3d-printing-trials/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:01:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>No, this is a wrap!</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-07-12-no-this-is-a-wrap/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a brilliant idea, or so I thought, to hand-build a middle layer for the Fourier with some polymer clay. The thing about polymer clay is that it's super cheap and comes in a ton of colours, it's also blendable so you can fully customize the shade. But it just wasn't meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the clay was soft enough to mold, it was pretty easy to build on to the bottom layer of the keyboard plate, but then I was left with a dilemma of how to bake the clay. I tried removing the clay from the plate but this left it distorted and with fingerprints. I was also trying to line up the top and bottom plates to ensure the middle layer was a perfect fit, and it kept getting into the pcb/switches which was making it hard to remove. So after a few attempts at making guards/molds/templates with no success I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think it's not a bad idea for anyone wishing to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the aftermath. I had to use a cotton bud and some alcohol to clean up the residue from the switches and plates, which was fine, when I noticed some fine scratches on the base plate of the keyboard. I had used a knife to gently trim/shape the clay in one of my attempts and accidentially scratched the plate. No big deal, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wrong!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time had passed after this when I noticed some behavioural issues with the keyboard. As it turns out, the fine scratches were just enough to expose the conductive layer of the base plate, which was making just enough contact with the pro micro to cause a short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the microcontroller survived with no damage and I was able to fix the issue with some electrical tape. Problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even better, while I was using some post-it notes to test the space between the microcontroller and the board, I realized, they were the same colour as the keycaps. What luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though I don't have a super ballin' hand-built middle layer to match the exact shaed of my orange keycaps, I was able to wrap the brass standoffs in orange to up the aesthetic a notch or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valuable lesson from my last build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Solder pro micro header pins to the board first, not the pro micro.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Put down some electrical tape before attaching the pro micro.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Trim the pins from the switches after soldering, they may not look long but they can still cause problems. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flush cutters are your friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fourier</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><category>staggered</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-05-28-breakfast-of-champions/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 13:00:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wait is over!</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-05-27-the-wait-is-over/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; possible to build a mechanical keyboard, and a sweet one at that, on the cheap.

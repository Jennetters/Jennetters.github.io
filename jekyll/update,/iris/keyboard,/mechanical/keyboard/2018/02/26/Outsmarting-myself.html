<p>First of all: How are MOFSETS so small? I saw them in the package but I didn’t realize the itty bitty thing that I received was just a container holding two much smaller ittier bittier things that I literally need to hold with tweezers to solder. Egads. I think I did it just fine. No problemo.</p>

<p>So I was pretty confident that I could finish the rest of the soldering, and then this happened:</p>

<p><strong>Wait, where did the rest of the build guide go?</strong></p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>So the build guide is not complete, which is fine, I’m a smart cookie, or so I thought. When I reach the end of the <a href="https://docs.keeb.io/iris-build-guide.html">available build guide</a> and there’s just a few bullets left, like “Solder Pro Micro header pins”, I use my master skills of google-fu to figure this out. I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37mW1i_oEpA">great video on Youtube</a> with instructions/tips for soldering the pins and was super proud of my soldering job….</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>… Until I realized that there was no conceivable way to get the switches soldered to the board and the Pro Micro if you solder the pins to the Pro Micro first. I missed the memo (spoiler alert, it wasn’t there) that you were meant to solder the pins to the PCB first. In Keeb.io’s defence, they do have an imgur album of the full build, it’s not explicitly detailed but it will get you through the process with very little trouble.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, I did not make progress, I spent the rest of the night desoldering and even had to resort to asking for help to get it done.</p>

<p>True story: The Pro Micro looks like it’s been chewed by a dog. Oops.</p>

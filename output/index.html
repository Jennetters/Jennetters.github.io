    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>From the "not so hot-off-the-press" files comes a build that's been on my to-do list since February. I was asked to have a go at the <a href="https://github.com/ramonimbao/dactyl-ez2print">Dactyl EZ-to-Print</a>... turns out it wasn't <i>that</i> easy to actually print. I had some difficulties with sagging and getting thex openings for the switches to stay crisp but in the end, I made it work.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/dactylEZ/Dactyl_is_Art.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Art!"></div>

<p>With all the parts ready to go I started following the assembly on the repo for the case, but it looks you're meant to put the back on before wiring, just to hold it together... soooooo I went rogue and did my own thing.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/dactylEZ/DactylEZ2PrintParts.thumbnail.jpg" alt="3D Printed Components to build the Left half of the keyboard"></div>

<p>Stay tuned for progress.</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Woooaaah nelly! These Dactyl boards sure are popular!</p>
<p>Spoiler Alert: That's because they're great!</p>
<p>I post a lot projects that I'm tinkering with on my <a href="http://www.instagram.com/jennettereid">instagram</a> account and my boss reached out to me to ask about comissioning a custom Dactyl Manuform as a surprise for his wife! WHEE! Of course I was totally up for it!</p>
<p>I really, really, love building mechanical keyboards but I already have 4. Considering I only have one desk and one set of hands, there's no way I need more (Said no member of r/mechanicalkeyboards, ever.). If I can build keyboards for other people, then I get the joy of building them <strike>and none of the hassle of choosing a favourite among my keyboard babies. Err, forget I said that.</strike> That's not to say I'm open to doing comissions for just <i>anyone</i>, they do take up a considerable amount of my time.  I already have too many hobbies to squeeze into what little free time I do have. </p>
<p>After going over some options, we decided to keep the board relatively quiet and went with linear switches (Cherry MX Red) for the alpha keys, and Tactile switches (Cherry Brown) for the modifiers. This gives some more feedback when typing and learning to type on the dactyl. We also decided, since he liked the gradient of my Iris keycaps, to get the keycaps printed from <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD Keyboards</a>. I've used them before and their customer service is outstanding, the prices are very reasonable and they're lightening quick with production. The bonus with designing your own keycaps is that you can change the labels to suit your layout.</p>
<p>Again, this was printed on the Prusa is MK3 with black PLA filament which really needs no finishing. I find that's the biggest bonus of upgrading my printer. All that's left to do after printing is ripping out the supports, which is kind of the best part!</p>
<p>So after waiting for the rest of the supplies to arrive (RJ9 Cables and Connectors, and some more Microcontrollers) it was finally time to assemble. </p>
<p>Here's the finished board, I think it's really sharp! (I know, I know I'm biased. What's your point?)</p>

<p>I'm going to need to take a break for a while, although I still have some pro micros, switches, cables and connectors on hand.... you know, just in case.</p>

<p>This has been a collaborative work-in-progress for the better part of two months. Collaborative in that Dana was the designer and I was the builder. </p>
<p>So my bestie, Dana, wanted a Dactyl that was purple and loud. Easy. We both scoured Aliexpress and put together a list of keycaps that would work for ortholinear keyboards (it's hard to find sets that are 1-u so you need to be creative with the available caps in a stock set.) and I got all the other components ordered and this is the final result:</p>

<p>I should mention that I also use a mouse layer on this board and haven't used a physical mouse since September, so my hands are literally on the keyboard the entire time I'm at my desk. It's been pretty convenient and comfortable.</p>
<p>I've already received two requests to build more of these for friends/coworkers so I'll add pics/info when I get into that.</p>

<p>Not too shabby. Typing on the manuform has been much easier than I expected, the height is a source of mild discomfort so I will get myself a taller wrist support or print the matching ones to go with the dactyl. </p>
<p>My friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordo.j/" target="_new">Jordan</a> takes fantastic pictures so I asked him to help me grab some cool shots in the alley beside our office. Here's what he came up with:</p>

    </header><section class="post-excerpt"><div>
<p>Holy moly it's been a while and I've been staring at this keyboard every day wanting it to be done already!</p>
<p>Turns out, the body has cutouts for RJ9 connectors on the back, and even though I thought I was ahead of the game by ordering extra TRRS cables and jacks months ago, they left a big gap in the back of the case and that bothered me. I can be quite particular when the mood strikes so I waited (... and waited...) for RJ9 connectors to arrive from China.</p>
<p>Once the right parts arrived I was ready to finish this badboy! The schematic had 3 wires, and the jacks had 4... so I figured, "a wire is just a wire*, right?", and snipped one off. Then I proceeded to solder both halves the exact same way and flash the micro controllers.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/mJUkGUB"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mJUkGUB.jpg" width="500" title="source: imgur.com"></a></p>
<p>TADA!</p>
<ul>
<li>Except when it's a wire that you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much to my dismay, I discovered a bit too late that my RJ9 cable was a crossover cable and soldering both halves the exact same way meant that they weren't the same at all. So I had to desolder, replace one of the jacks and put it back together. But thankfully that was an easy solution and was quickly sorted.</p>
<p>I did my best to keep the wires neat and insulate whenever possible to avoid shorts but I wasn't happy with having an open bottom on the board. I was going to mock-up my own to print, but I was pleased to find that there are now STLS in the Dactyl repo for the bottom plates! Yahoo!</p>

<p>Now that the keyboard is finally finished, it's time to get used to it... hold on to your butts!</p>

<p>Why do I have so many keyboards?</p>
<p>Why indeed.</p>
<p>The Iris is my favourite board because it's the first one I built and is fully customized to my specifics.</p>
<p>.... but the Fourier is my favourite because it's staggered and since it's 40, it is really fun to use.</p>
<p>... but, but, but the Dactyl is my favourite because it's so ergonomic and pretty... </p>
<p>HOW CAN I POSSIBLY CHOOSE WHICH ONE(s?) TO TAKE HOME?!</p>
<p>I've been using the dactyl exclusively since bringing it to work and well... it's different:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/ZE2On6G"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZE2On6G.png" title="source: imgur.com"></a></p>
<p>I have faith! </p>
<p>This is my first board with blank keys, and it's actually not even part of my problem. I just need to get used to the shape. </p>

<script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I made solid progress starting the columns, using the <a href="https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard">assembly log from tshort on github</a> as a guide. Because I'm just soldering to the pins on the switches there's a lot less movement of parts, making it much quicker. I laid out the wire along the column and used a marker to note where the pins lined up, then stripped the wire at these points and was able to solder each column in more or less one go.</p>
<p>Next steps are to add the controller and trrs jacks. I know the dactyl assembly log uses rj9 cable, but I've got trrs jacks handy and a few extra cables so I'm going to give them a shot.</p>

<p>The time has come to begin the Dactyl Manuform!</p>
<p>Thanks to some incredibly fast shipping form Aliexpress, some forethought, and some borrowed supplies from co-workers I have everything I need to get cracking on this. Right off the bat, it's clear that completing the wiring in the case of the dactyl is tight at best, and downright impossible in the deepest corners where I found myself melting the case with the soldering tip more than once.</p>
<p>I had really grand visions of knocking everyone's socks off with how tidy my wiring was going to turn out, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. </p>

<script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Even though the quaity of this print is way better that anything I could produce, I found that some of the switches would pop out when removing the keycaps and considering there is no circuit board to hold them in place, you wouldn't want to rip out wires just for swapping a cap. For that reason, I used a bit of hot glue on the underside of the switches to help secure them to the case. I also added bits of hot glue to hold the wires where I wanted them for the rows, and I'll likely do the same for the columns. However, it's clear that this is ruining the aesthetic I was going for. <em>sigh</em></p>
<p>I'm also being doubly cautious and checking each solder connection as I go so that I, hopefully, will have a fully functioning keyboard when I'm done. I'm a little worried about shorts, but I think the hot glue will also act as insulation when needed and will secure the wires so there's no accidential connections.... </p>
<p>I think.</p>

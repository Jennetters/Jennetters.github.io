&lt;p&gt;I should mention that I also use a mouse layer on this board and haven't used a physical mouse since September, so my hands are literally on the keyboard the entire time I'm at my desk. It's been pretty convenient and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already received two requests to build more of these for friends/coworkers so I'll add pics/info when I get into that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too shabby. Typing on the manuform has been much easier than I expected, the height is a source of mild discomfort so I will get myself a taller wrist support or print the matching ones to go with the dactyl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordo.j/" target="_new"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; takes fantastic pictures so I asked him to help me grab some cool shots in the alley beside our office. Here's what he came up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/TnoaMML"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/TnoaMML"&gt;Completed Dactyl Manuform (5x6)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty great, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty darn pleased with this board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>photos</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-03-08-pictures-of-dactyl_manuform/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 20:45:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hand Wiring Adventures: Part 4</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-03-04-hand-wiring-adventures-part4/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy moly it's been a while and I've been staring at this keyboard every day wanting it to be done already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the body has cutouts for RJ9 connectors on the back, and even though I thought I was ahead of the game by ordering extra TRRS cables and jacks months ago, they left a big gap in the back of the case and that bothered me. I can be quite particular when the mood strikes so I waited (... and waited...) for RJ9 connectors to arrive from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the right parts arrived I was ready to finish this badboy! The schematic had 3 wires, and the jacks had 4... so I figured, "a wire is just a wire*, right?", and snipped one off. Then I proceeded to solder both halves the exact same way and flash the micro controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/mJUkGUB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/mJUkGUB.jpg" width="500" title="source: imgur.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TADA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except when it's a wire that you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to my dismay, I discovered a bit too late that my RJ9 cable was a crossover cable and soldering both halves the exact same way meant that they weren't the same at all. So I had to desolder, replace one of the jacks and put it back together. But thankfully that was an easy solution and was quickly sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did my best to keep the wires neat and insulate whenever possible to avoid shorts but I wasn't happy with having an open bottom on the board. I was going to mock-up my own to print, but I was pleased to find that there are now STLS in the Dactyl repo for the bottom plates! Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALL DONE, FINALLY!
Woo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-03-04-hand-wiring-adventures-part4/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 23:32:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Typing on the Dactyl Manuform, Day 1</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-03-05-typing-on-the-dactyl_manuform/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the keyboard is finally finished, it's time to get used to it... hold on to your butts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I have so many keyboards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iris is my favourite board because it's the first one I built and is fully customized to my specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.... but the Fourier is my favourite because it's staggered and since it's 40, it is really fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... but, but, but the Dactyl is my favourite because it's so ergonomic and pretty... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW CAN I POSSIBLY CHOOSE WHICH ONE(s?) TO TAKE HOME?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using the dactyl exclusively since bringing it to work and well... it's different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/ZE2On6G"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZE2On6G.png" title="source: imgur.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have faith! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first board with blank keys, and it's actually not even part of my problem. I just need to get used to the shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2019-03-05-typing-on-the-dactyl_manuform/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 23:32:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hand Wiring Adventures: Part 3</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-12-05-hand-wiring-adventures-part3/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping the wires to the controller was pretty quick work and ended up being less soldering than using a pcb where you need to use the header pins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last steps are to find a suitable cable, then programming and I'll be done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-12-05-hand-wiring-adventures-part3/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 02:04:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hand Wiring Adventures: Part 2</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-12-04-hand-wiring-adventures-part2/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a bomb, but it's gonna be &lt;i&gt;da bomb&lt;/i&gt;!

&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="aT0jeLr"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/aT0jeLr"&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made solid progress starting the columns, using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard"&gt;assembly log from tshort on github&lt;/a&gt; as a guide. Because I'm just soldering to the pins on the switches there's a lot less movement of parts, making it much quicker. I laid out the wire along the column and used a marker to note where the pins lined up, then stripped the wire at these points and was able to solder each column in more or less one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps are to add the controller and trrs jacks. I know the dactyl assembly log uses rj9 cable, but I've got trrs jacks handy and a few extra cables so I'm going to give them a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-12-04-hand-wiring-adventures-part2/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 03:10:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hand Wiring Adventures: Part 1</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-12-02-hand-wiring-adventures/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time has come to begin the Dactyl Manuform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to some incredibly fast shipping form Aliexpress, some forethought, and some borrowed supplies from co-workers I have everything I need to get cracking on this. Right off the bat, it's clear that completing the wiring in the case of the dactyl is tight at best, and downright impossible in the deepest corners where I found myself melting the case with the soldering tip more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had really grand visions of knocking everyone's socks off with how tidy my wiring was going to turn out, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/u9Jv7SH"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/u9Jv7SH"&gt;Dactyl Build 12-01-2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the quaity of this print is way better that anything I could produce, I found that some of the switches would pop out when removing the keycaps and considering there is no circuit board to hold them in place, you wouldn't want to rip out wires just for swapping a cap. For that reason, I used a bit of hot glue on the underside of the switches to help secure them to the case. I also added bits of hot glue to hold the wires where I wanted them for the rows, and I'll likely do the same for the columns. However, it's clear that this is ruining the aesthetic I was going for. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also being doubly cautious and checking each solder connection as I go so that I, hopefully, will have a fully functioning keyboard when I'm done. I'm a little worried about shorts, but I think the hot glue will also act as insulation when needed and will secure the wires so there's no accidential connections.... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-12-02-hand-wiring-adventures/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 01:24:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>3D Printing Success?</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-11-19-3d-printing-success/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many, many attempts at printing the cases for the Dactyl and many upgrades and repairs to our printer I figured it just wasn't meant to be.

&lt;p&gt;As much as I wanted to do it by myself, sometimes you need to ask for help along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just need a few more supplies and then I'll be ready to start building! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl manuform</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-11-19-3d-printing-success/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 03:28:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fourier Upgrade!</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-08-fourier-upgrade/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time for Halloween... latest upgrade to the Fourier!&lt;/p&gt;

Attempt 1 of ??</title><link>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-07-3d-printing-trials/</link><dc:creator>J.Net</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a keyboard off of a purchased PCB has been fun, but like any good mechanical keyboard junkie, you very quickly discover that it's a slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole reason I started on this journey was to be able to get my hands on the most ergonomic keyboard, for my poor hands, that I could possibly find. And it wasn't long before I started lusting after a Dactyl of my very own. With no readily available PCB's it's a bit more of a challenge to build, but I think after building 2 keyboards successfully, I can figure it out with a little help from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step one - Picking the right Dactyl for my needs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the easy part. I really like the Dactyl Manuform and think the 5x6 is ideal: https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been flip-flopping between the Iris (50%) and Fourier (40%) and like them both quite a bit, for different reasons, but I think that the Iris is a bit more user-friendly for everyday use. That's the main reason why, I'm opting for more keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step two - Building the case. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D Printing is finicky business. I purchased a second-hand printer to learn the ropes and with hopes of getting a Dactyl out of it. It was clear from the start that the resolution was more suited to drafts but I still had high hopes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of tinkering and practicing on smaller items to iron out the details, I was ready to give the Dactyl a go... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="GMI8ns0"&gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/GMI8ns0"&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it was clearly a failure. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>3d printing</category><category>dactyl</category><category>mechanical keyboard</category><category>ortholinear</category><category>split mechanical keyboard</category><guid>https://jennetters.github.io/posts/2018-09-07-3d-printing-trials/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:01:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

<p>Finally had a chance to open up the keyboard and see what the problem was with the dead keys. As it turns out, the issue with the U and J keys was that I didn't solder the switches. And here I thought I was being so careful, must have been over excited. So I solderd those and plugged the board in and TADAA!!! Right half is fully functional.</p>
<p>As for the left half, which had the dead row. Well, this is my life now.</p>

<script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I checked all of the diodes and paths, but I could see one pin on the controller didn't appear to be soldered, so I tried to solder it and it just. wouldn't. flow. I'm confident that I damged the Pro Micro when I desoldered it on Monday and the connection for that pin is just toast. I tried several times and couldn't get it soldered to make the connection.</p>
<p>So, here I am faced with a really, really gross dillemma. Because of the construction of the board/case plates, if I want to get at the top side of the board to remove the header pins and attach a new Pro Micro, I've literally got to desolder all of the switches on the board in order to be able to remove the plate. </p>
<p>Super disgusting, right?!</p>
<p>In an ideal world, I could desolder the Pro Micro and leave the pins on the board, then just put a new one in its place. This was harder than it seemed, even though it looked like I had a clean pin I still couldn't get the Pro Micro off. So, I did what any sane person would do, I grabed some pliers and wire cutters and obliterated the pro micro, leaving the pins intact. Then I desoldered the pins and cleaned everything with a little bit of rubbing alcohol. Good as new... if new was chewed up by a dog and spit out.  </p>
<p>Attaching the new Pro Micro onto the existing header pins which were a little less than straight was a bit of a challenge, I used some needle nosed pliers to feed them through one at a time but I managed to get it and solder it down.</p>
<p>Now I'm back to having issues flashing the board because, Wandows. </p>
<p>And once again, it's way past my bedtime.</p>

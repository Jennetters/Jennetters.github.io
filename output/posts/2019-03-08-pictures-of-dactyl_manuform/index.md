Getting better!

Not too shabby. Typing on the manuform has been much easier than I expected, the height is a source of mild discomfort so I will get myself a taller wrist support or print the matching ones to go with the dactyl. 

My friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordo.j/" target="_new">Jordan</a> takes fantastic pictures so I asked him to help me grab some cool shots in the alley beside our office. Here's what he came up with:

Pretty great, right? 

I'm pretty darn pleased with this board.

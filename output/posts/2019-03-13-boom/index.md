After a solid week of using the Dactyl Manuform exclusively at work my typing is just about back to where it was before:

I should mention that I also use a mouse layer on this board and haven't used a physical mouse since September, so my hands are literally on the keyboard the entire time I'm at my desk. It's been pretty convenient and comfortable.

I've already received two requests to build more of these for friends/coworkers so I'll add pics/info when I get into that.

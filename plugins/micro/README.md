# The Microblogging Plugin

## Description

Allows the easy creation of microblog-style posts without titles. The `type` metadata is set to `micro`, and the `title` is set to the current time in 24-hour format; for example, 145515. 

This will only have any major impact if you are using a theme which does anything special with posts like that. I recommend my own **GruberWine**, which I should be publishing at around the same time I publish this plugin.

## How to Use it

Just as for creating a new post, but run:

```
nikola micro
```

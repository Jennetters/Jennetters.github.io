<p>I've been using a 60% keyboard for some time after I realized my wrists were more comfortable when I didn't have to leap over the (rarely used) number pad to reach the mouse throughout the day.</p>
<p>Being a software tester, and somewhat of a computer junkie, I do spend a great deal of time on a computer. I had an ergonomic assessment at work recently, and the only further modification they could suggest to me was a split keyboard which sounds like fun... but most of the boards I came across were massive and not truly "split" where you could customize the angle, they just came with a gap of sorts. See: Microsoft Sculpt. Gross.  </p>
<p>There were a few nice-ish ones out there, See: Kinesis Freestyle, but they were not cheap and it was at this point I figured, if I'm going to spend money on a split keyboard, I'm going to get one that I love.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, I work in a tech start-up with a mixing pot of people from different backgrounds and interests. I can be in a slack channel for Cat Lovers, Mechanical Keyboards, Video Games, Craft Nights, or Pickling. It's pretty great! So into #keyboards I went and, well... let's just say it was kind of like jumping down a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>Speaking to the people in our mechanical keyboards community, #keyboards, it became obvious that what I wanted does not exactly exist, so it's time to get my learninng on.</p>
<p>Here we go wheeeeeeeeeeee!</p>

Did someone say Rabbit Hole? Yeah. Me.

There's a lot of information. A lot, a lot.

I have a vision in my head of a keyboard in the flavour of/inspired by Scootaloo. _What's a Scootaloo?_ If you know what I'm talking about without me telling you, let's be friends. Deal? Deal.

Before I can make a themed keyboard of any kind, I need to know which keyboard I want to make, the sky's the limit here.

My top choices are:

* [Iris](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard) - My top choice but it's constantly selling out.
* [ErgoDox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) - Since my thumbs are a large part of my problem, I'm worried it's too big.
* [Zen](https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/category/group-buys/zen-keyboard_41/) - I like the low profile of this.

I've been scouring reddit/imgur/everywhere for reviews and pics and I'm convinced that the Iris is my top choice but it seems that a lot of the options/parts are constantly sold out on their site.

I'm pretty sure there's something superawesome lurking in a corner of the internet that I have yet to discover. But that can always be for Keyboard2.0.

Being an adult (or a reasonable facsimile of one) and having hobbies is pretty fun because you can kindasorta do what you want. There's not really someone telling you that you can't have the thing that you want, your imagination is the limit, and your wallet...This is my life now:

"Hey cool, you're going to build your own keyboard? I bet you'll save a lot of money."
 **cue laugh track**

So, the first part of building your own keyboard (after research) is easy, but it's not for the faint of heart, as it involves throwing money at ridiculous things that you don't actually need, but you totally _need_.

Here's most of the sites I used:

[AliExpress](http://aliexpress.com)  
 - I decided to go with Cherry Switches, I used a mix of mostly Reds and some Browns  
[Hidden Lab](http://hidden-lab.com)  
 - Hidden Lab has some wicked cool keysets, and they also have these nifty thermochromatic keycaps which I wanted for my WASD keys.  
[Keeb.io](htt://keeb.io)  
 - Iris PCB's, Case Plates, Pro Micros  
[WASD](http://wasdkeyboards.com)  
 - Custom Printed Keycaps  
[Pexon](http://www.pexonpcs.co.uk)  
 - Custom TRRS and micro USB cables  
[Hot Pop Factory](http://www.hotpopfactory.com)  
 - This is a local company that I asked to cut acryllic for the case since I didn't want it 3D Printed.  

Without a doubt the next part is going to be the hardest... waiting for all of the things you ordered to arrive.

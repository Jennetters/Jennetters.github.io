I have done the thing! Today (right now, in fact) my new pretty keyboard is fully fuctional!

I had a co-worker flash the keyboard on his mac, thanks for nothing Wandows, which worked without issue. So now here I am with my new sweet setup and having a grand old time fighting muscle meory.

Not too long ago I borrowed a co-workers "let's split" and I managed to average 44 which is not terrible. Right now my biggest problem is that I used the upper thumbkeys for space which feels less natural. I can move them later if it becomes a problem. That's the beauty of a custom keyboard.

Onwards!

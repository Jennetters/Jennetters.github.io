I knew from the very beginning that I would settle for nothing less than the best cables and, of course, I wanted them the way I wanted them.

These cables are exactly what I had in my head, they're perfect. 

The hot pink of the cables matches the acrylic used for the case, but I didn't forsee that the black plates on the keyoard would affect the colour of the case as much as they do, giving it a more orange look. I do have a few ideas for offsetting the orange colour, for one I still haven't added LEDs to the keyboard, that'll help, and/or I could possibly line the inside facing surfaces of the plates with white paint/film/etc to help reflect the pink. 

For now, I'm thrilled that everything is the way I wanted it.

With all of these pieces in place and the Iris being complete, I need another project to start... Hmm... decisions, decisions.

In honour of Star Trek Day here's a wise vulcan proverb from Yoda; "<b><i>Do. Or do not. There is no try.</i></b>‚Äù.

Seems relevant.

Last year on May fourth I was travelling back from Birmingham, UK, and wore my Rogue One tshirt in honour of Star Wars day. It was fun that many of the airport officials/security guards noticed it. Yes, I did actually say "May the fourth be with you" to a customs officer. 

Anyway.

Building the Iris keyboard was fun, but anyone who's built a mechanical keyboard knows that it can quickly become a bit of an addiction/hobby... I need moooore. 

I've seen a few variations of the [Dacyl keyboard](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard) and I want one. Real bad. Part of my obsession stems from the hunt for an ergonomic split keyboard and this is some next level stuff. It's dreamy. I've also stumbled across a few different build guides where people hand wired them. So I think that's my next challenge. Who doesn't want to dabble in some pcb-free electronics every now and then? This brings me back to Yoda's quote and my approach to all the things:

<b>Pfft. I can do that too.</b>

Since I'm still super in love with the Iris keyboard, I'm not giving her up and won't go as crazy ordering custom <i>everything</i> for the Dactyl, but I'll make it look good. I'm going to keep it a bit more cost effective, as much as you can when building a mechanical keyboard, anyway.

Time to play the waiting game... again.

For fun, I also ordered parts to build Keeb.io's Fourier 40% staggered split, because. Just because. 

For added funtimes, I also, also ordered a Chocopad PCB, from [Keeb.io](https://keeb.io), and some Kailh switches/caps, from [NovelKeys](https://novelkeys.xyz), to make a macropad for gaming. We'll see how that goes another other time. 

Back to waiting...

Here's a May 4th throwback to my last day in Birmingham, right before heading to the airport.

Note my sweet selfie skills.

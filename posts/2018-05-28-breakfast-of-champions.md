I'm sure I'm not the only one who can't rest until a project is finished, so I grabbed a coffee and got back to soldering.

Valuable lesson from my last build:

<ol><li> Solder pro micro header pins to the board first, not the pro micro.
<li> Put down some electrical tape before attaching the pro micro.
<li> Trim the pins from the switches after soldering, they may not look long but they can still cause problems. 
<li>Flush cutters are your friend.</ol>

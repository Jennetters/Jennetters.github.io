After many, many attempts at printing the cases for the Dactyl and many upgrades and repairs to our printer I figured it just wasn't meant to be. I was running out of filament, so I asked a friend with a much (<i>much</i>) nicer printer to help me out.

As much as I wanted to do it by myself, sometimes you need to ask for help along the way.

Just need a few more supplies and then I'll be ready to start building!

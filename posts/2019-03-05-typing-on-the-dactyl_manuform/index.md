Now that the keyboard is finally finished, it's time to get used to it... hold on to your butts!

Why do I have so many keyboards?

Why indeed.

The Iris is my favourite board because it's the first one I built and is fully customized to my specifics.

.... but the Fourier is my favourite because it's staggered and since it's 40, it is really fun to use.

... but, but, but the Dactyl is my favourite because it's so ergonomic and pretty... 

HOW CAN I POSSIBLY CHOOSE WHICH ONE(s?) TO TAKE HOME?!

I've been using the dactyl exclusively since bringing it to work and well... it's different:

I have faith! 

This is my first board with blank keys, and it's actually not even part of my problem. I just need to get used to the shape.

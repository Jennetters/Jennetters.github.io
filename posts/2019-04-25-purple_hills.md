This has been a collaborative work-in-progress for the better part of two months. Collaborative in that Dana was the designer and I was the builder. 

So my bestie, Dana, wanted a Dactyl that was purple and loud. Easy. We both scoured Aliexpress and put together a list of keycaps that would work for ortholinear keyboards (it's hard to find sets that are 1-u so you need to be creative with the available caps in a stock set.) and I got all the other components ordered and this is the final result:

Not the best pictures, but you get the idea.

I couldn't wait to share with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bhhf3m/my_bestie_requested_a_purple_keyboard_that_was/">r/mechanicalkeyboards</a> and... well now I have a whole lot of people wanting to be my best friend. Hah, joke's on them. There's no room at the inn.

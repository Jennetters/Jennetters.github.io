From the "not so hot-off-the-press" files comes a build that's been on my to-do list since February. I was asked to have a go at the <a href="https://github.com/ramonimbao/dactyl-ez2print">Dactyl EZ-to-Print</a>... turns out it wasn't <i>that</i> easy to actually print. I had some difficulties with sagging and getting thex openings for the switches to stay crisp but in the end, I made it work.

With all the parts ready to go I started following the assembly on the repo for the case, but it looks you're meant to put the back on before wiring, just to hold it together... soooooo I went rogue and did my own thing.

Stay tuned for progress.

When you change-up your keyboard layout, or shape, you'll notice your typing accuracy and speed takes a nosedive. Thankfully it bounces back pretty quickly. After using the Dactyl Manuform for so long, I believe I can say without a doubt that it has improved both of these things. The shape of the wells for the switches means my fingers have to move less than ever before with standard keyboards, and not having a physical mouse means my hands can stay in one position for the duration of my work.

Ok, so it's not earth-shattering, or record-breaking, but it's not too shabby either and certainly an improvement for me.
